# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Project Structure

This project follows a standard structure for Expo (React Native) applications:

- **`app/`**: Contains all the screens and routing logic, managed by Expo Router.
  - **`(tabs)/`**: Likely contains layout for tab-based navigation.
  - **`services/`**: Modules for interacting with external APIs (e.g., AI services, backend). Contains API client configurations and data transformation logic.
  - **`utils/`**: Utility functions and helpers used across the application (e.g., data manipulation, formatting).
  - **`constants/`**: Global constants like theme colors, API endpoints, configuration values.
  - **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks for reusable stateful logic.
- **`assets/`**: Static assets like images, fonts, etc.
  - **`fonts/`**: Custom font files.
  - **`images/`**: Image files used in the app.
- **`components/`**: Reusable UI components shared across different screens.
  - **`ui/`**: Potentially more generic, foundational UI elements.
- **`scripts/`**: Utility scripts for project management (e.g., `reset-project.js`).
- **`tasks/`**: Task definitions and generated task files if using a task management system like Task Master.
- **`.expo/`**: Files generated by Expo, related to the Expo build process.
- **`.vscode/`**: VS Code editor specific settings.
- **`node_modules/`**: Project dependencies (managed by npm/yarn).

### Naming Conventions

- **Directories and Non-Component Files:** `camelCase` (e.g., `app/utils/apiClient.ts`, `app/hooks/useUserData.ts`).
- **React Component Files:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `components/ui/Button.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/HomeScreen.tsx`).
- **Variables and Functions:** `camelCase` (e.g., `const userName = ...`, `function getUserProfile() {...}`).
- **Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `const API_KEY = '...';`).
